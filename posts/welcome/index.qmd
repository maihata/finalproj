Welcome to my blog! I created this blog as part of my [Educational Data Science](https://education.uoregon.edu/) course at the University of Oregon, where I am a doctorate student in educational leadership. Just a few months ago, I was completely new to R, RStudio, and GitHub.

I also work as an Autism & Behavior Consultant at an outreach agency, [Early Childhood CARES](https://earlychildhoodcares.uoregon.edu/), in the College of Education. This role motivated me to learn more so I can better support infants and toddlers who experience Autism and/or Developmental Disability and their families.
