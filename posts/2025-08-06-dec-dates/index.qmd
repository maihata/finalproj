I’m excited to learn the dates for our presentations at DEC25 in Portland! \
\
On 10/8/25, I’ll be sharing findings from my dissertation, which examines service exit patterns in Early Intervention across the U.S. and in Oregon. Using a QuantCrit lens, I analyzed who is most likely to be found ineligible or dismissed, and how equity-centered data practices can better support all families. \
\
I’ll also be co-presenting a meta-synthesis on transitions from Early Intervention to Early Childhood Special Education (EI-ECSE) on 10/10. I am so very grateful for this opportunity! \
