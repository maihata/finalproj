This is the first step in my visualization series. I created a simple kable table using data from the Office of Special Education Programs ([OSEP](https://data.ed.gov/dataset/idea-section-618-data-products-static-tables-part-c)).

To give some background, my dissertation will focus on equitable access to [Early Intervention (EI)](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/parents/states.html) for different groups. Some of the visualizations in this blog will be adjusted to allow for stronger statistical analysis, such as by incorporating census data.

Hereâ€™s what my dataset looked like after I finished wrangling the data:

```{r include=FALSE}
race_us_chart <- read_csv("/Users/hata/Desktop/finalproj/Data/race_us_chart.csv")
```

```{r}
print(race_us_chart)
```

This may look simple, but just a few months ago, I was completely new to R, RStudio, and GitHub. I used many functions for data wrangling, including `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `bind_rows()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, `pivot_longer()`, `pivot_wider()`, and `summarize()`.

```{r include=FALSE}

kable(race_us_chart, 
      caption = 
        "Exit Reasons and Race (National)") %>% 
  kable_styling(
    full_width = F, 
    position = "left")
```

```{r}

kable(race_us_chart, 
      caption = "Exit Reasons and Race (National)", 
      align = "c") %>%  
  kable_styling(
    full_width = F, 
    position = "center",  
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%   
  row_spec(0, align = "c")                           

```

I will build on this simple table to start analyzing the data more deeply. But first, I will show how disparities appear across the United States, where racially marginalized children are often under-served in EI, unlike in K-12 special education.
