I am very excited that [our publication is now out](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sel.2025.100115)! This qualitative study looks at how Oregon educator preparation programs are implementing the new Social and Emotional Learning standards, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities. The findings offer insights to guide ongoing adoptation of SEL standards and reflects a lot of what Iâ€™ve been learning, especially around culturally and linguistically responsive provider training for improved quality of services. \
