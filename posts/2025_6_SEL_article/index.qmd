Very excited to share that [our publication is now out](linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2773233925000397)! This qualitative work explores how Oregon educator preparation programs are implementing the stateâ€™s new Social and Emotional Learning standards, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities they face. Findings offer insights to guide ongoing improvement and adaptation of SEL standards in teacher preparation and reflects a lot of what Iâ€™ve been learning, especially around culturally and linguistically responsive provider training for improved quality of services. \
