Thank you in advance to those planning to join me at [DEC 2025 in Portland, OR](https://www.decconference.org/)! I'm really looking forward to sharing part of my dissertation in the presentation, How Often and Why Are Marginalized Families Dismissed from EI Services?, scheduled for Wednesday, October 8. I've uploaded [my slides](DEC25_EIExits_presentation.pdf) and [handouts](DEC25_EIExits_handout.pdf) below, and I'd love to keep the conversation going! Please feel free to connect by [email](mailto:hata@uoregon.edu) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maikohata/). You can also follow my progress on [this website](https://maihata.github.io/finalproj/) or take a look at [Maiko's CV here](Maiko_CV_26.pdf). I'm grateful for your interest and for being a part of this important work toward more equitable EI services!
