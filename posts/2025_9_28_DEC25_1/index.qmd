It’s been a while, and I hope you’ve been doing well! Over the past six months, I’ve been busy collecting, cleaning, and analyzing datasets from [Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP)](https://data.ed.gov/dataset/idea-section-618-data-products-static-tables-part-c) and [Oregon Department of Education (ODE)](https://www.oregon.gov/ode/Pages/default.aspx). As I get ready to share part of this work at [DEC 2025 in Portland, OR](https://www.decconference.org/), I’ve uploaded the slides and handout from my presentation: “**How Often and Why Are Marginalized Families Dismissed from EI Services?**” Wednesday, October 8.

Thank you so much to those who joined me at the session! I’d love to keep in touch. Please feel free to reach out by [email](mailto:hata@uoregon.edu) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maikohata/).
