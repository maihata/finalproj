    "title": "Racial disparities in EI exit patterns",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Here, I performed a chi-square test and used standardized residuals to interpret the results. I visualized the findings with corrplot(), one of my favorite packages. As I mentioned in my previous post, children exit Early Intervention (EI) services for various reasons. I wanted to examine whether there are disparities in how they exit based on their racial backgrounds.\nChi-square test determines if the distribution of a sample is different from what we would expect by chance (Agresti, 2013). It helps researchers understand whether the differences between observed and expected counts are likely due to random variation (Morgan et al., 2020). Standardized residuals shows how much the observed counts differ from the expected ones, considering the influence of independent variables on dependent variables (Chatterjee, 2011). This visualization helps us identify where the largest disparities exist between expected and actual exit patterns across race.\nThis is when I truly understood the power and flexibility of R, as it allowed me to present the story of the data through clear and intuitive visualizations.\nDo you notice how group 2 is over-represented and group 7 is under-represented in Attempts to Contact Unsuccessful (“Dismissed”)? Also, group 7 is noticeably underrepresented in Part B Eligibility Not Determined (“Not Determined”), but the same group is over-represented in Complete or Not Eligible (“Not Eligible”).\nLet’s see who these groups are.\nHere is my first attempt. Even though it’s a bit messy, I was really impressed that I could run this analysis and create the visualization so easily.\n\ncorrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n         is.cor = FALSE, \n         tl.cex = 0.7)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, I renamed the columns and rows, and experimented with different plots.\n\ncorrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n         method = 'square', \n         is.cor = FALSE, \n         tl.cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncorrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n         method = 'ellipse', \n         is.cor = FALSE, \n         tl.cex = 0.6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI finally settled on this version, where I:\n\nChanged the letter color to black as the red was unnecessarily alarming\nMoved the label numbers further out for easier reading\nReordered the exit categories alphabetically.\n\n\ncorrplot(chi_results$stdres, \n         is.cor = FALSE, \n         tl.cex = 0.8, \n         tl.col = \"black\", \n         cl.cex = 0.7,     \n         cl.offset = 1,    \n         cl.ratio = 0.2)    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my dissertation, I will analyze similar data broken down by home language status and Medicaid eligibility."

    "title": "Data Visualizations for Educational Equity",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Data Visualization for equitable EI access\nIn this data visualization and storytelling portfolio, I conducted a secondary data analysis of extant data. These data were published by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) and Oregon Department of Education (ODE). OSEP collects annual data on children, aged 0 to 2, who have stopped receiving Early Intervention (EI) services, with information categorized by gender, race, and ethnicity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatasets\nBetween 2013 and 2021, 3,310,559 infants and toddlers with disabilities and/or developmental delays received and exited Early Intervention (EI) services nationwide (U.S. Department of Education [DOE], 2025). In Oregon, 29,945 infants and toddlers received EI services during that time (DOE, 2025). In the following sections, I’ll explore the data for all children who were eligible for EI services and stopped receiving them between 2013 and 2022, using visualizations and storytelling to highlight key insights.\n\n\nExit reasons\nWhen children turn three, they transition from being served under IDEA Part C to IDEA Part B, which manages providing free, appropriate public education for children ages three to 21 with disabilities (Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center, 2024). The IDEA Section 618 requires that the data is collected on children who had an active IFSP who stopped receiving services, or “exited” EI services (U.S. Department of Education [DOE], 2024).\nInfants and toddlers receiving EI services exit under one of 10 categories. Since some reason codes fell outside the scope of this study, they were either omitted or combined, resulting in six broad categories used in this visualization series.\n\n\n\n\n\nExit Reasons\nExit Category Codes\n\n\n\n\nDismissed\nAttempts to contact the parents and/or child were unsuccessful\n\n\nMoved Out\nMoved out of state\n\n\nNot Eligible\nA child is no longer eligible for Part C prior to reaching age three; Not eligible for Part B, exit with referrals; Not eligible for Part B, exit with no referrals\n\n\nNot Determined\nPart B eligibility not determined\n\n\nWithdrawn\nWithdrawal by parent (or guardian)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing forward\nFor my dissertation, I will examine how infants and toddlers from different racial groups are represented in Early Intervention (EI) compared to census data. I will also conduct chi-square analyses with adjusted standardized residuals to explore exit patterns in ODE data based on children’s home language(s). I am also requesting similar data that include breakdowns by children’s Medicaid eligibility to examine how Socio-Economic Status (SES) influences exit patterns. I will share extensive quantitative data to amplify the voices of the families highlighted in my literature review.\nThank you for reading, and feel free to stay connected through my LinkedIn page!"

    "title": "Odds ratio for EI exit by Dismissal",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Here, the data storytelling really comes together. Based on the previous analysis and visualization of the chi-square results with standardized residuals, I decided to run odds ratios for some of the most notable cells that showed statistically significant disparities.\nAs I mentioned in my previous post about this project’s background, when children turn three, they transition from receiving services under IDEA Part C to IDEA Part B (Early Childhood Technical Assistance Center, 2024). Infants and toddlers exit Early Intervention (EI) services for various reasons, and significant disparities exist in how children from different racial backgrounds experience this transition.\nThe odds ratio analysis measures how much more or less likely an outcome is for one group compared to another (Hosmer et al., 2013). However, if not used mindfully, the results can be too simplistic and may end up reinforcing common narratives that unfairly blame certain groups for disparities. This kind of oversimplification ignores the complexity of intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1989) that marginalized communities live. It’s also worth noting that Karl Pearson, who created the chi-square test, is believed to have developed statistical tools to support eugenics (Castillo & Strunk, 2025, p. 3).\nFirst, I ran an odds ratio analysis for the “Dismissed” exit category across all racial groups. Then, I tried creating bar charts to visualize the results.\n\nggplot(or_us_white, \n       aes(x = factor(group, \n                      levels = sort(unique(group))), \n           y = odds_ratio)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_hline(\n    yintercept = 1, \n    linetype = \"dashed\", \n    color = \"red\") +  \n  labs(title = \"Odds Ratios Compared to White (Reference)\", \n       x = \"Race\", \n       y = \"Odds Ratio\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# with flipped coordinates\n  ggplot(or_us_white, \n         aes(\n           x = factor(\n             group, \n             levels = sort(unique(group))), \n           y = odds_ratio)) +\n  geom_col(\n    fill = \"skyblue\") +\n  geom_hline(\n    yintercept = 1, \n    linetype = \"dashed\", \n    color = \"red\") +  \n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Odds Ratios Compared to White (Reference)\", \n    x = \"Group\", \n    y = \"Odds Ratio\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, using a forest plot for odds ratio has traditionally been considered appropriate, because they can show confidence intervals, making it easier to understand the precision of each estimate. To create a forest plot, we need to prepare a table that includes not only the odds ratios but also the confidence intervals for each comparison.\nHere, I used geom_errorbar() from ggplot().\n\nggplot(or_us_white_ci, \n       aes(x = group, \n           y = odds_ratio)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, \n             color = \"skyblue\") +  \n  geom_errorbar(aes(\n    ymin = ci_lower, \n    ymax = ci_upper), \n    width = 0.2) +  \n  geom_hline(\n    yintercept = 1, \n    linetype = \"dashed\", \n    color = \"red\") +  \n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Forest Plot of Odds Ratios\",\n    x = \"Race\",\n    y = \"Odds Ratio\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, I reversed the alphabetical order of the Y-axis.\n\nor_us_white_ci$group &lt;- factor(or_us_white_ci$group, levels = rev(sort(unique(or_us_white_ci$group))))\n\nFinally, I made the following adjustments to make the chart easier to read:\n\nIncreased the size of the blue dots\nMade the the X-axis labels larger\nAdded data labels above the dots.\n\nDo you see how the odds ratios highlight the over- and under-representations in the “Dismissed” category? (Just a reminder, this category represents cases where agencies “lose contact” with families, leading to disqualification.)\n\nggplot(or_us_white_ci, \n       aes(x = group, \n           y = odds_ratio)) +\n  geom_point(size = 4, \n             color = \"skyblue\") +  \n  geom_errorbar(aes(\n    ymin = ci_lower, \n    ymax = ci_upper), \n    width = 0.4) +  \n  geom_text(aes(\n    label = round(odds_ratio, 2)), \n    vjust = -1.5, size = 3.5) +  \n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1, \n             linetype = \"dashed\", \n             color = \"#7ad151\") +  \n  coord_flip() +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Odds Ratio for Exiting EI via Dismissal (National)\",\n    x = \"Group\",\n    y = \"Odds Ratio\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor my dissertation, I plan to re-analyze the same datasets by comparing each group to the overall category average across all races. This way, I can avoid using White children and families as the norm for comparison.\nI will also examine how infants and toddlers from different racial groups are represented in Early Intervention (EI) compared to census data. I will then conduct chi-square analyses with adjusted standardized residuals to explore exit patterns based on children’s home language(s) and Medicaid eligibility in Oregon. Additionally, a comprehensive literature review incorporating both quantitative and qualitative studies will help amplify the voices of the families.\nThank you for reading, and please stay connected through my LinkedIn page!"

    "text": "Hello and welcome! I’m Maiko (here’s how to pronounce my name, like “Mike-Oh”), an Early Intervention (EI) & Early Childhood Special Education (ECSE) Specialist, Autism Consultant, trainer, and doctoral candidate at the University of Oregon.\nOver the years, I have worked closely with families of young children with disabilities and/or developmental delays, teachers and fellow providers. In my previous career, I also supported international students from a wide range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds. While these roles might appear quite different, both deepened my understanding of how language, identity, and systemic barriers shape access to support, and how our own beliefs and values influence the way we engage with each other. They also motivated me to keep learning so I could better support young children and the families working hard to advocate for them.\nMy dissertation explores differences in EI access and exit patterns. My current research explores equitable access to EI services, focusing on how race, language, and systemic factors impact who receives support and how services end. I use data tools like R to better understand the patterns behind the numbers and to help systems be more responsive to the communities they serve.\nLooking ahead, I hope to work with future educators and researchers as they explore topics like educational access, family-centered practices, and data equity. This site is where I share some of that journey. I’m glad you’re here.\nI hope you’’ take a moment to explore more about my Projects and my Professional History. I look forward to connecting via LinkedIn page or Email, too!\n\n\n\n\n\nオレゴン大学博士課程（教育リーダーシップ）に在籍している畑 麻衣子です。オレゴン大学にて療育・自閉症のスペシャリストとして勤務しています。博士論文のトピックは療育における教育機会と格差です。Educational Data Science スペシャライゼーションの一環として、当サイトを作成しました。ユニバーサルデザイン、自閉症、ペアレントコーチング、教員教育も研究中。大阪高槻出身、大阪弁が恋しいです。\n詳しくは Projects、履歴書 からどうぞ。LinkedIn とEmail でのご連絡もお待ちしております。"
